# Transparent-Government-In-Fact-Website
USA Congress Website that displays live data from ProPublica API through AJAX calls. Made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js and Bootstrap.

In "main.js" folder (Master branch):
fileName = window.location.pathname;

- You will see that the pathname of every page begins with "/Transparent-Government-In-Fact-Website" followed by the name of the file (/index.html, /senate-data.html...).
- If you download the project and open it locally, the data won't fetch. You need to change "fileName" variable, deleting the first part of it ("/Transparent-Government-In-Fact-Website"), just file name + extension.

*Vue branch is in progress.
